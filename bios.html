                    <p>
                        From Kurt Cobain, to Zach De La Rocha, to Olivia Rodrigo, Dave dazzles
                        the audience with exciting vocals across many genres. Having over 25 years
                        of experience with the acoustic guitar, Dave also backs up his singing with
                        the rhythm guitar in the band.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>
                        Dave started playing in high school and was a former member of The Leftorium -
                        an acousting duo with Kevin McNamara. The Leftorium played shows around Charleston
                        for about 7 years at great venues such as: Sesame Burgers and Brew (multiple locations),
                        Wine Down, and Coastal Coffee Roasters.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>
                        These days he is venturing out from the acoustic and has explored with electric - you'll
                        find him changing instruments throughout the shows.
